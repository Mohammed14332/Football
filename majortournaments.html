    <h1>World Cup</h1>
    <img src="worldcup.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      World Cup is also one of the biggest tournaments in football, but World
      Cup is not for football clubs. World Cup is for national teams from around
      the world. In the World Cup it is also 32 teams that qualifies. To qualify
      to the World Cup each continent divides the countries into groups and one
      country from each group qualifies to the World Cup. Then there is one team
      from each group in Europe that play the playoffs to try and qualify to the
      World Cup .Except from South America, all the national teams play in one
      group of 10 countries and four countries qualifies to the world cup. One
      thing that make the World Cup rare is that it is only played once every
      four years. The last time the World Cup was played was in 2018 and France
      was the national team that won it. The World Cup is played like the Champions 
      League with group stage, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinal and final. 
      The only difference in that the World Cup has a game after the semifinal and 
      before the final, this game is played for the third place. In the final you 
      have a winning team and the team that comes on the second place, but in the 
      World Cup two teams play for the third place.
